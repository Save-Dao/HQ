# Methodology for for Internal Projects.

We should keep a registry of internal projects that we as a Dao would like to work on.

### Is a full Dao Campaign Needed?

For small tasks where just one Member can handle it, a Proposal can be submitted directly to the Member through the dao.
For larger tasks where a team is needed, normal Save Campaign methodology should be followed.

1. Form Save Campaign
2. Summon Multisig
3. Submit proposal to the Dao (with funds going direct to the Save Dao's Multisig)
