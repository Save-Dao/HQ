## Summary of Work

DeFi Zap is planning to release their "unzap" feature in the next two weeks and would like to do a redesign of the "zap cards" on the [explore zaps](https://defizap.com/zaps) page of the website.

### Design

- Cleanup and simplify the information architecture and design of the [Zap cards](https://defizap.com/zaps) and the [detail page](https://defizap.com/zaps/llplink) for the zaps.
- Add the "unzap" button to the cards / detail page (in a way that makes sense)
- Analyze filtering, organization of different types of Zaps
- Deliverable => Figma file
