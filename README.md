# WTF is the Save Dao?

The Save Dao is a dao for builders to form Save Campaigns and team up on epic boss fights (open source web3 projects). Development, Design, Marketing, Product, Cryptoeconomics.

## Manifesto

- We believe in Web3, and are here to build it, use it, propagate it.
- We ONLY accept crypto.

## How we work

### Save Dao

A Save Campaign is a small agile team built from members of the Dao. Save Campaign can be formed to tackle both internal and external projects.

### External Projects

External projects can hire the Raid Guild to help them. External projects are taxed 10% which goes back to the Dao Bank. Funds in the Dao Bank can then be deployed to internal projects.

### Internal Projects

Internal projects are our own ideas from the Dao. Can be funded directly by the Dao or an external funder.

## Meetings & Cadence

Guild Members can interface asynchronously at any time in the Save Dao Discord.
